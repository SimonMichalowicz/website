    <h1>My first website learning</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>This is a page where I practice new techniques as I learn them so the rest of the site can be structured better so please excuse the mess!</strong></p>

        <h1>This is the main header.</h1>
        <p>This is the first line of text in the website.</p>
        <h2>This is an h2 heading.</h2>
        <p>This is the second line of text in the website.</p>
        <h3>This is an h3 heading.</h3>
        <p>Headings can go from h1 to h6 in terms of importance.</p>

        <h1>Bold and Italic text</h1>
        <p>Here is some <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text!</p>
        <!-- This is an html comment. Strong is used for bold and em is used for italic in html -->
        <!-- I can also use <strong><em> to make text bold AND italic </strong></em> -->
        <!-- we can use <b> and <i> but it won't add meaning to text readers for accessibility DO NOT USE -->

        <h1>Making Lists!</h1>
        <!-- This is an unordered list using <ul> and lists as bullet points. <li> is used to list each item-->
        <ul>
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Orange</li>
            <li>Apple</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- An ordered list uses <ol> and will list with numbers -->
        <ol>
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Orange</li>
            <li>Apple</li>
        </ol>
        <!-- We can use start='int' to specify where an <ol> should start counting from -->
        <!-- <ol reversed> lists in reverse order. <li value = 'int'> will change that items list value and subsequent values counting up -->
        <dl>
            <dt>Banana</dt>
            <dd>Is a long yellow fruit with lots of potassium!</dd>
            <dt>Orange</dt>
            <dd>Is a cirtus fruit named after it's color.</dd>
            <dt>Apple</dt>
            <dd>Is a red or green fruit thats chewy and delicious.</dd>
        </dl>
        <!-- This is a description list using <dl> with <dt> for title element and <dd> for description element -->

        <h1>Making Links.</h1>
        <h3>Homepage</h3>
            <p>Below is an example of an external link and a relatice link.</p>
            <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
            <!-- This is a hypertext link using an anchor <a> and href =  to link to a website, picture or other document. MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE HTTP OR HTTPS when linking externally -->
            <a href = "./about.html">About</a>
            <!-- This is an relative link on the same website and assumes the domain name is the same -->
            <!-- If the file is in a different directory we need to include ./ then the folder locations to the file. The ./ means look relative to current directory-->
        
        <h1>Using Images</h1>
        <img src="../img/dog.jpg" alt="Dog Image">
        <!-- Using <img> to put images on a webpage. We do not need </img> on this code! We can also use an aboluste path like a website to link to images online -->
        <!-- We can also start an image location with .. if we need to go 'up one step' in the directories to enter a different folder -->
        <!-- alt is used to give the picture a name for text readers and if the website wont load properly. MUST INCLUDE -->
        <!-- CSS note: we can adjust an image height and width with img {height: ***px width: ***px} or use auto instead of px count.-->
        <!-- IMPORTANT we should use auto for height and adjust width manually to avoid proportion loss-->
        
        
    <!-- Selectors-->
    <!-- Selectors are a part of CSS code that select HTML code that CSS rules apply to-->
    <!-- * is the symbol for universal and every element would have the rule applied in a * {   } selector.-->
    <!-- An element selector will apply the rules to all types of that element e.g. <p>{  } would apply to all <p> elements -->
    <!-- Class selectors apply the rule to all items of the given class (a class is an attribute we assign). Class selectors are a period followed by the name of the class e.g. .class{  }-->
    <!-- ID selectors should be used sparingly. Unlike class selectors they can only have ONE ID. ID selectors are a # followed by the ID e.g. #thisid {   }-->
    <!-- We can put multiple selectors with the same declartions together then seperate below e.g. .read, .unread { same  } .read { .read unique } .unread { .unread unique }-->
        
    <!-- We can set color with color and background color then use color: rgb(set 3 values) or use a keyword like red -->
    <!-- font-family can be used to set preferences for fonts (use "" if whitespace is in the font name) start with a specific font first and widely generic last -->
    <!-- font-size: **px will set font size. font-weight: 1-1000 will select boldness. text-align: will align text to a value set e.g. center or left-->
