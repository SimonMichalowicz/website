      <dt>March 2022</dt>
      <dd>Began my journey to learning how to become a software programmer by doing a 4 hour tutorial on youtube on C# after speaking with a friend on the best 
        language for game design. Completed video in two days and went to find more structured way of learning.</dd>
      <dt>April 2022</dt>
      <dd>Signed up for Computer Science 50 with Harvard online. Completed weeks 0 and 1 gaining an understanding of how computers work and creating my first
        piece of code in scratch - a version of pong set in a garden themed level. It was mostly bug free! Moved on to C language in week 1 and learnt how to 
        construct pyramids of # in C</dd>
      <dt>May 2022</dt>
      <dd>Completed weeks 2-4 of CS50 learning about sorting, arrays, objects, memory, algorthims, pointers among other skills. Completed exercises
        to make an election program that would count votes and declare a winner and a program that can create Caesar cyphertext. Seperately decided to take a
        python course called Python For Everyone for a bit of variety and completed the 15 week course in 4 weeks. Gained a basic understanding of Python but after
        CS50 found most of the syntax came naturally and really appreciated Pythons ease of use over C. As part of the PY4E course read a book on Networking by
        Charles Severance (the tutor for PY4E) and now understand how the internet works!</dd>
      <dt>June 2022</dt>
      <dd>After completing the PY4E course and aware that CS50 would be teaching with Python shortly returned to CS50 to work on the pointers exercise of week 4 but
        got distracted by a number of mentions of the Odin Project and decided to take a look as a free course for web develepment. Enjoyed the beginner lessons and 
        exercises set and have gained an understanding of how git and github work, how html is used... to be continued.</dd>
